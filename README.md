It allows you to send Eth directly to farcaster IDs, and allows withdrawal on money on-chain!

*The whole record of farcaster IDs and the money they are worth is recorded on-chain.*

You can tip people directly to farcaster, by just using their farcaster usernames!

**Here is a demo video:**

## Wen Mainnet

The codebase is provided in this repo, and before we go mainnet and allow people to deploy real Eth, we need to do improve the contracts to make them more safe! The repo will updated as soon as the frame is launched!

**Upcoming Events:**
- Improving UX: The hackathon was on Frames, and hence the service is built on tops of frames, but a bot will provide more ideal UX.
- Mainnet: Launching this on Mainnet :)
